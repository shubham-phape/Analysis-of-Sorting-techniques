# Sorting-Techniques-Analysis

I have implemented the sorting algorithms in java.

• Heapsort

• Quicksort (Using median of 3)

• Insertion sort

• Bubble sort

In this project I did an analysis run time on all of these sorting algorithms above for varied input sizes.

The resulted report of analysis is as below:
